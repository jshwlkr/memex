A person employing [epistemic outsourcing](https://apxhard.com/2021/04/26/p-%e2%8a%82-np-causes-political-polarization/) can not consider an idea unless they have witnessed some amount of their peer group also consider that idea. To this end they would find it imposible to accept a belief that shocks or upsets their peer group. When they witness their peer group testing or considering an idea they must do the same, though this does not imply they must agree or disagree with this idea.
