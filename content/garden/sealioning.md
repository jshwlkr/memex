Sealioning is a form of bad faith debate where a troll (the "sea lion") incessantly demands evidence or asks repeated questions while maintaing a pretense of sincerity. The term originated in a [Wondermark strip](http://wondermark.com/1k62/). Sealioning is an argument ad nauseam (argument by repetition).
